# Introduction to Mathematica for Physics 

This is a set of six Mathematica notebooks and supplementary notes that I developed at the University of Saskatchewan as part of an introductory quantum mechanics course. The six tutorials build consecutively on one another, and introduce students to using Mathematica in order to solve common physics problems related to quantum mechanics.  

The six tutorials cover:
  - Mathematica syntax and Calculus
  - Sums, Series, and Special Functions
  - Solving Equations and using Modules
  - More on Modules, and Linear Algebra
  - Solving Differential Equations
  - Troubleshooting Errors in Mathematica
  
Each tutorial is a Mathematica notebook/slideshow which includes explanatory text, example code, and exercises.
